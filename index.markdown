I'm haily, a multidisciplinary scientist with expertise spanning complex systems science, social and developmental neuroscience, and artificial life. *I am currently looking for a postdoc beginning summer or fall 2025.*

I am interested in the origins and consequences of sociality with an emphasis on experience, environment, interaction, and dynamics. Given that my work and other's emphasizes the pervasive impact of our social relationships, I try to practice what I preach by building community. This looks like building bridges between fields, supporting (especially historically underserved) trainees, and fostering an inclusive, equitable, and welcoming classroom.
