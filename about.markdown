My name is Haily, and I'm a dual PhD student at Indiana University in Informatics and Cognitive Science. I use computational methods (like network analyses and dynamical models) to study how brains calibrate to the social environment. 

Before grad school, I managed a neuroecology lab at Cornell. As an undergrad, I studied Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Central Eurasian Studies at Indiana.

Outside of academia, I love reading, painting, and gardening.
