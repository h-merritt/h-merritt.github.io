I am interested in building a network neuroecological perspective on sociality. For me this involves studying sociality from two perspectives.

On the one hand, I study human brain networks to see how variation in network topology is related different experiences in the social environment. For example, how are the brain networks of individuals who have high quality, supportive relationships different from individuals who experience high levels of loneliness, rejection, or hostility in their social environment?

On the other hand, I build simple models of neural and social systems to understand how collectives adapt to changing environments and how quality social support might facilitate adaptation. I use analytical tools from dynamical systems theory, information theory, and psychophysics to understand the behavior of these simple systems and connect that behavior to humans.
